# CollabIncNewGradAssessment
The objective of this new grad assessment is comparing two csv files that contain emails with a discrepancy.
In addition, an error will be asserted if the files are NOT distinct. The primary algorithm that was used is the 
 LEVENSHTEIN Distance, which compares the similarity between two strings. Here were the follwowing implementations I tried
to implement:
  Experiment 1. React - I was unable to figure out how to integrate React with csv reading styles
  Experiment 2. NodeJS- Having trouble running certain packages
  Experiment 3. Embedded Javascript within HTML - This took a lot of time and research which involved using the FileReader package to parse the csv files
Some other methods that I used was CSVtoArray and x to output the necessary list of emails. Even though this take-home exam took a while,
it was truly fantastic and rewarding! You can easily run test.html in a browser (Google Chrome preferablly).
